<div>
    <p>
        Performs an HTTP request, and returns a response object.
        <p>Usage example:</p>
        <pre>
        def response = httpRequest 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/api/json?pretty=true'
        println("Status: "+response.status)
        println("Content: "+response.content)
        </pre>
        <p>If Jenkins restarts after the HTTP request is made, but before the HTTP response is received, the HTTP request fails.</p>
        <p><tt>validResponseCodes</tt> is a comma-separated string of single values or <tt>from:to</tt> ranges. For example <tt>'200'</tt> to accept only <tt>200</tt> or <tt>'201,301:303'</tt> to accept <tt>201</tt> as well as the range from <tt>301</tt> to <tt>303</tt>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The methods of the response object are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <tt>String getContent()</tt>: The HTTP Response entity. This means the text of the response without the headers. If the response does not contain an entity, <tt>getContent()</tt> returns null.
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>int getStatus()</tt>: The HTTP status code.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
